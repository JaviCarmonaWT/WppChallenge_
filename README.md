------------
While it´s very impressive that today´s technology allows us to gather incredible amounts of data, the reality is much of the data is currently collected before anyone answers: “What do we want to do with this data?" The result: WPP has a lot of data and people don´t know about it.

For this challenge we have worked with a concept always on mind: **Data for business.** What this means? Easy, means that we are going to work in a dashboard where people who is not used to work with data understand all the data that WPP have available.

As we said, our objetive (and the objetive of the challenge) is to create an easy and usefull dashboard, but also a dashboard always updated, now with 276 datasets and in one year from now with 3.000 of datasets, the dashboard must be updated easy and fast to make all the data accesible to all the WPP Group. 

#### Challenge topics

- **Insigths:** Clear insights are very important, understand in a easy way what data WPP have and if it is usefull for the anyone who arrive to our dahsboard, we try to look for insights  that are not readily visible and answer to questions like when o where.
- **Visualization:** We decided to use DataStudio because it is very easy to connect to multiple platforms and it fits perfect with the dashboard we want to develope. 
- **Comprehensiveness:** Interesting insights but easy to understand with clear and direct charts that were updated when a new dataset were uploaded.
- **NLP Approach:**
- **Code:** All the code was beed developed to be usable and let us to have the dashboard always updated. We have used the dataset of url-collection-topic as starting point, from there, we use the urls to extract all the metadata from de dataset and work with it. After you add a new dataset to this dataset you only have to execute the code to have the dashboard full updated.
